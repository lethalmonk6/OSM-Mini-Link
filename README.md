The OSM-Mini Link is a customized version of the OSM-Mini https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/3D%20Prints/Open%20Stick%20Modular%20-%20Mini%20(OSM-Mini), modified to include a compartment to hold a removable Phreakmods Link Shaft with topper.
It is designed to fit a Sanwa JLF rotated 90 degrees.

The overall dimensions of the case are 250mm x 200mm x 50.8mm

The top panel layout is the 6GAWD layout by jonyfraze, condensed to fit within the case dimensions and modified to use all 24mm buttons.


The Link Holder Knub is adapted from https://github.com/BolSadguy/Link-Holder-2.0. It should be printed in SLA Resin for strength.

The rest of the case is printed in FDM PLA.

## 3D Printing
Per guidelines from the OSM-Mini
>Each piece should be placed flat down on the print bed to ensure maximum strength.
>Each of the corner pieces should be oriented on their outside facing large surface flat down and printed at the lowest possible layer height to ensure a good quality print.

The Left Side Panel should also be printed outside face down.

The Link Holder Knub should be printed in SLA Resin for strength.
The rest of the case is printed in FDM PLA.
