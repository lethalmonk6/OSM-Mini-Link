# OSM-Mini Link
The OSM-Mini Link is a customized version of the OSM-Mini https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/3D%20Prints/Open%20Stick%20Modular%20-%20Mini%20(OSM-Mini), modified to include a compartment to hold a removable Phreakmods Link Shaft with topper.
It is designed to fit a Sanwa JLF rotated 90 degrees.

The top panel layout is the 6GAWD layout by jonyfraze, condensed to fit within the case dimensions and modified to use all 24mm buttons.


The Link Holder Knub is adapted from https://github.com/BolSadguy/Link-Holder-2.0. It should be printed in SLA Resin for strength.


The rest of the case is printed in FDM PLA.
